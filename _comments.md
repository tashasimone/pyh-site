## After final submission

Very successful overall. Some of the execution between responsive stops leads to design being a bit float and too open. Some containment/border between elements would help, but its something to watch for with responsive and flexbox.

## After MP2-B

In great shape. Excellent microformatting overall!

* Lets use a single image for the ratings: 3 out of 5; 4 out of 5; etc. 
* Consider a `div` to wrap the review content in case they're every more than 1 paragraph.
* A little more organizing markup on `product.html` might be necessary down the road.
* Let's use `<!DOCTYPE html>` instead of the older `<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">`
